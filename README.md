# Search-For-HPD
This is a code to find HPD

Here is The Problem

**Let us consider the following dataset follows an exponential distribution with scale parameter ${\theta}$.Let us consider the prior for ${\theta}$. Obtain posterior distribution, Bayes estimator, and 0.95 HPD interval for the parameter.**  

**3.29, 7.53, 0.48, 2.03, 0.36, 0.07, 4.49, 1.05, 9.15,3.67, 2.22, 2.16, 4.06, 11.62, 8.26, 1.96, 9.13, 1.78, 3.81, 17.02**
